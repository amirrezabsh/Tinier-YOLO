**Tinier-YOLO: A Real-Time Object Detection Method for Constrained Environments**

Welcome to the Tinier-YOLO repository! This is a Python implementation of Tinier-YOLO, a real-time object detection method designed for constrained environments. This project is based on a published article on IEEE and is a part of my Digital Image Processing course in the second semester of my MSc program.

## Overview

Tinier-YOLO is a streamlined version of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm, optimized for environments with limited computational resources. This implementation focuses on achieving high performance and real-time detection capabilities, making it suitable for embedded systems and mobile devices.

## Features

- **Real-Time Detection**: Optimized for speed to ensure real-time performance.
- **Lightweight Architecture**: Reduced model size for deployment in constrained environments.
- **High Accuracy**: Maintains competitive accuracy despite the reduction in model complexity.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on the chosen backend)
- OpenCV
- Numpy

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amirrezabsh/tinier-yolo.git
   cd Tinier-Yolo

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

### Usage
1. Training: Follow the instructions in TRAINING.md to train Tinier-YOLO on your dataset.
2. Inference: Use the provided scripts to perform object detection on images or video streams.
